AWS has launched ECS Managed Instances, a new compute option that blends the managed simplicity of serverless with the full flexibility of EC2, allowing specific instance types (like GPUs) while AWS handles the underlying infrastructure management.

Running containers on [**Amazon ECS**](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/) has always involved a choice. **Fargate** offers a simple, serverless experience but is restrictive, lacking control over specific hardware (like GPUs) and blocking privileged container capabilities needed for advanced networking. The **EC2 Launch Type** offers full control to choose any [**EC2 instance**](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) but comes with the full burden of managing, patching, and scaling the cluster.

## The Solution: ECS Managed Instances

In a recent [**announcement blog post**](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/announcing-amazon-ecs-managed-instances-for-containerized-applications/), AWS introduced **ECS Managed Instances**, a new compute option that perfectly bridges this gap. It provides the operational simplicity of a managed service while retaining the flexibility to choose specific EC2 capabilities, offloading the infrastructure management to AWS.

## Key Features and Considerations

ECS Managed Instances introduce a unique managed model with important features and trade-offs:

* **Security Lifecycle:** Instances have a **14-day maximum lifetime**. AWS automatically replaces them to apply security patches to the underlying **Bottlerocket OS**, meaning applications must be stateless or able to tolerate planned restarts. For security, direct SSH access is disabled; you must use **Amazon ECS Exec** for debugging.
* **Enhanced Capabilities:** Unlike Fargate, it supports running **privileged containers** (e.g., `CAP_NET_ADMIN`), which is essential for certain service meshes or monitoring agents. It also optimizes costs by placing **multiple tasks on a single instance**, a key difference from Fargate's isolated environment per task.
* **Pricing:** The pricing model is straightforward, you pay for the EC2 instances plus a separate **management fee**.
