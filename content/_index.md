title: Hello There

I'm **Miguel**, originally from [Tenerife, Spain](https://maps.app.goo.gl/QoJz1JZsM4w9tTqs5), now based in [Leicester, UK](https://maps.app.goo.gl/oK1RmSCska8D9TAa9). 

Professionally, I work as a **DevOps Engineer** with a focus on cloud infrastructure, automation, CI/CD, and building scalable and resilient systems. I enjoy working with technologies like Containers, Terraform, and Go.  

Outside of work, I like to explore new tech, contribute to open-source projects, and automate everything I can.  

This website is a place for me to share insights, projects, and things I find interesting.
